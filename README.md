Motivation
The need to address the urgent issue of climate change is becoming increasingly critical. While governments worldwide are debating and implementing policies and agreements to tackle this challenge, it is essential to recognize the role of individuals in contributing towards this goal. However, people often find it difficult to understand how their daily activities impact the environment and what they can do to reduce their carbon footprint. In response to this challenge, we propose an innovative IoT solution that helps individuals monitor their carbon emissions and take action towards creating a more sustainable world.
